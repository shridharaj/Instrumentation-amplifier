# Instrumentation-amplifier
## Aim : 
To design and analyse instrumentation amplifier using 741 IC Op-amp in LTSpice Simulator 
## Theory:
An instrumentation amplifier is a type of differential amplifier designed to amplify small signals while rejecting noise and interference, especially common-mode signals. It is extensively utilized in sensors, data acquisition systems, and medical devices where precise, low-level signal amplification is necessary. The amplifier is perfect for removing signals from noisy environments because it usually has a high input impedance, a low output impedance, and an excellent common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). In order to enable simple gain adjustment with a single resistor, its architecture typically consists of three operational amplifiers: two for buffering the inputs and one for amplifying the difference between them.
## Design Question: 
Design an instrumentation amplifier using 3 op-amp configuration with the following constraints:
a) R1 = R2 = R3 = R4 = R5 = R6 = 100kΩ
b) Difference gain ADM = 20V/V
(Vcc = ±13.5V)
Find ACM (Common mode gain) & calculate CMRR for ADM = 20, and 50 V/V - use LT spice simulator.
## Calculation:
### For ADM =20v/v
